Data: Collection of raw facts
Data Now: is Huge and Unstructured
Data science Life cycle
    1-> Data Acquisition
    2-> Data Pre-processing
    3-> Machine Learning Algorithm
    4-> Pattern Evalution
    5-> Knowledge Representation
Data Acquisition:
    Data form Multiple Source --> Data Storage --> Target Data
Data Pre-processing
    raw untiedy data to tiedy format data
    1. Data Manipulation
    2. Data Visualization
Machine Learning: Application of intelligent algorithm to find meaningful information from the data
    1. Classification
    2. Regression
    3. Clustering
Model Evaluation(Pattern Evaluation)
Knowledge Representation 
    1. Aesthetic Graphs

Introduction to Machine Learning
    1. Supervised Learning
    2. Unsupervised Learning

Supervised Learning:
    Input Variable:- x
    Output Variable:- y | Y = f(x) to find out the relation between x and Y
    Types: (requried Label data)
    1. Regression:  Y(dependent variable) = f(x: independent variable)
    2. Classification: estimate the relationship between different entities
        independent Variable(input) and dependent variable(output)
Unsupervised Learning:
    Clustering: (No Label assosiated with data)
    (raw image/Unkown)
    this data is feed to unsupervised learning Model
    1. Intracluster Similarity: (High Similarity)
    2. Intercluster Dissimilarity
    (Aim is To increase Intracluster Similarity and Intercluster Dissimilarity )
Linear Regression (Y = a + bx)
Measure of Good fit:- to find the residual(difference between observered and predicted)
    Sum of residual should be minimum: (Yo - Yp)^2
Multiple Linear Regression: More number of independent Variable

Genreal Data: 
    1. Import the Data
    2. Clean the Data
    3. Split the data into Traininh/Test Sets
    4. create a Model
    5. Train the Model
    6. Make Predictions
    7. Evaluate and Improve

Decision Tree:
    Classification and Regression (Both)
    Decision take place at each nodes
